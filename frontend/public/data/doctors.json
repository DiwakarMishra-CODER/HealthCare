He is also involved in research work related to pulmonary diseases. He is a strong believer that practice of medicine is \"an art as well as a science\" and so always honestly practices evidence-based medicine but with a practical and human touch [sevabhav] with utmost human ethics.\nAnother unique part of his practice is that he believes in working as a team with a group of doctors [equally trained as him and personally mentored by him]. The team of doctors around Delhi/NCR works as per a fixed protocol/guidelines so that each and every patient is taken care by his team doctor in a similar manner as he himself would have taken care of them. This ensures that all patients are always given GOOD QUANTITY OF TIME (patient hearing) and a QUALITY TIME without overstretching any individual doctor and without patient moving from one corner of the city to another.\n\"He and his team treat all their patient as they would do for their family.\""

  "summary": "Rheumatic disease refers to any type of arthritis, certain autoimmune diseases, musculoskeletal pain disorders, and osteoporosis. There are over 100 conditions that range from common conditions. Arthritis can affect anyone of any age, including children, though women tend to be affected more than men. Pain can vary from mild to disabling, but all symptoms must be evaluated as they can indicate far more serious underlying problems.\n\nMany types of rheumatic diseases are not easily identified in the early stages. Rheumatologists are specially trained to do the detective work necessary to discover the cause of swelling and pain. It is important to determine a correct diagnosis early so that appropriate treatment can begin. Some musculoskeletal disorders respond to the treatment in the early stages of the disease."

  "summary": "As Chairman for APRC Healthcare, Dr. Ravindra Kumar brings to the company over 15 years of experience in clinical and executive leadership.\nHe is the founder of the company and started the first rehabilitation centre at the head office itself. The second centre was started within two years and over time the number of facilities has now reached 10.\nAs an advisor, he utilized his expertise in practicing clinical evaluation to help physical therapy practice owners establish and enhance their skills. Dr. Kumar earned his Master of Physiotherapy in Sports in order to expand his expertise.\nHis philosophy is:\n\"It's difficult to witness the deterioration of physical abilities in a parent, grandparent or any other loved one. Many of my patients' caregivers discuss the transitional challenges they experience when the responsibility for their dear one’s health and comfort becomes one of their integral roles. The task can be intensely overwhelming -- both emotionally and financially. Hence, it is our collective responsibility to give the best service to our patients and make the society, at large, active and independent.\""

Subsequently, he underwent a fellowship in interventional neurological surgery from the University Hospital, Zurich, Switzerland under the guidance of Professor A. Valavanis, Director of Institute of Interventional Neuroradiology, a living legend in the field of Interventional Neuroradiology. And he spent his time FROEDTERT Hospital, University of Wisconsin, U.S.A.\nHe possesses vast experience in the field of Neurosurgery, has been performing neuroendovascular ( spoke and brain haemorrhage) procedures for more than 21 years, and is among a handful of Neurosurgeon in India who are formally trained in both micro-neurosurgeries as well as neuro-interventional surgeries.\nHe has an inherent advantage to offer optimum treatment modality to the patients, as he has surgical perspective in addition to the interventional radiological dimensions of neurological disorders.\nHe works in a busy ‘neuroscience department’ and performs the variety of diagnostic and therapeutic neuroradiological procedures in addition to the micro neurosurgical procedures.The department is well- equipped with state of art Siemens ARTIS BIPLANE neuro-vascular a cath lab one of the only ones in town, ZEISS PENTERO microscope and brain lab neuro navigation STRIKER CUSA along withall kinds of cranial and spinal dedicated neuro endoscopes amongst others to highlight a few of the equipments making it a complete Neurological center. The unique feature of this integrated neuro-sciences center is 8 bedded neurocritical care ICU which probably contributes to our better outcomes.\nHe has been a co-author of textbooks of neurosurgery and is in the editorial board of Neurology India and various other national and international journals and is a prominent speaker at national and international conferences. \n"

  "summary": "Dr. Pankaj Kumar, a medical doctor by training and diet & fitness enthusiast and consultant by passion is the brain behind Mawkish Clinic and Diet Plus Minus. His idea of weight and fitness management is not only backed by authentic work done in this field but also combines radical and path-breaking innovations in proper dietary management. Over the years he has gained great popularity among his clients who hail from different strata of society. The cured patients are a living testimony of an effective and unique style of diet management without much compromise on the taste and amount of food involved. The personal guidance, mentoring, and counseling provided by him not only motivate the clients to cure obesity, diabetes, fatty liver, PCOD, hormonal imbalance at such ease and speed but also goes a long way in easily adopting a healthy lifestyle in long run. He is a strong believer and propagator of the idea that healthy living is a right of each individual which should be an attitude in each one of us rather than imposed by any external stimulus.\nThe mawkish clinic was started in the year 2016 as a venture by Dr. Pankaj Kumar. His diverse exposure gained while pursuing MBBS in Bankura Sammilani Medical College and Hospital and Post-Graduation from Sir Ganga Ram Hospital, New Delhi has helped him in coming into contact with some of the greatest medical minds in the country. He has efficiently amalgamated the experience gained by him with new works in the field of medical sciences and applied them successfully in his practice. The mawkish clinic, over the years, has made a special place among thousands of patients who have been cured by his efficient hands.\nMeanwhile sensing a strong need for specialized care and attention for diseases cropping out of lifestyle disorders, Dr. Pankaj thought of starting Diet Plus Minus (dietplusminus.com) with a strong focus on patients suffering from complications like diabetes, fatty liver, obesity, PCOD, post-pregnancy weight gain, infertility due to obesity, premature ejaculation, erectile dysfunction, etc. Diet Plus Minus is a unique blend of medical knowledge and time-tested wisdom in treating lifestyle disorders. Patients are provided with personalized and customized counseling which helps them in living a balanced life with increased confidence and self-esteem.\nHe provides customized as well as generalized diet plans which help in multiple medical conditions. He does not use any medicine or supplements or any fancy crash diet to lose weight. In addition to this, he provides an idea of a maintenance diet after the completion of 3 months or the end of the course. We all know that every individual is different and their body responds differently to diet and exercise and this very fact forms the basis of each individual case that he takes. For him, each case is a project in itself and hence he puts adequate enthusiasm and attention to individual details in framing diet plan and regimen.\nWeight loss and/or customized diet plan plays a pivotal role in long term management of the following diseases\n\n1.\tArthritis\n2.\tChronic gastric disorder\n3.\tDiabetes\n4.\tFatty liver\n5.\tHigh triglycerides, cholesterol\n6.\tHypertension\n7.\tInfertility (associated with obesity)\n8.\tIrritable bowel syndrome (IBS)\n9.\tObesity\n10.\tPolycystic ovarian disease\n11.\tPost-pregnancy weight gain\n12.\tSexual disorders like erectile dysfunction, premature ejaculation\n13.\tSnoring\n14. Thyroid disorder and many more…"
